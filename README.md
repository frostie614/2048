# my2048
My attempt at solving the 2048 game using Rust [Practice]


I am trying to learn rust. I was looking for projects (from small to large) that would allow me to learn rust. I came across 2048 and thought that would be a good place to start. Once the game is implemented, I will attempt to write a search alg to solve it.

Any input would be appreicated. Also new to Github!


I used RosettaCode's as a guide (its almost identical, turns out I know less rust than I thought (read: none)).

Anyway, that code helped me throughout.. got a few errors which i managed to sort.. the pain was all the unexplained warnings I was getting.. Eventually figured them out..

Although rust has been a complete pain in the arse.. I like it!.

So here it is after my first edit! [11/12/16]
